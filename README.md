### About Me

I am M.Mozaffar, a programmer with 4 years of experience. I have worked on various startup projects. I specialize in creating high-performance web applications and developing bots while also implementing security measures to prevent bot traffic.

From the very first day of my programming journey, I started working on the backend and web scraping of my startup projects. Since then, I have learned a lot and have successfully implemented my projects in production. I have an interest to make everything automated, and I like automation in general :)
